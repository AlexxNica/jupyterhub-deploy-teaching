As a simple, reusable JupyterHub deployment for your reference, this
repository enables installation and deployment of JupyterHub and nbgrader
on a single server. The deployment is designed for teaching a small to medium
group of trusted users. The reference deployment follows best practices and
has been used by Professor Brian Granger when teaching "Introduction to
Data Science".
